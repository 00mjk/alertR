alertR Sensor Client Development
======

This client is only for developers. It has no purpose than to emulate sensors and to trigger them via keyboard input. This means it can not be used as a daemon and have to be actively used.


How to use it?
======

To use this client you have to configure it first. A commented configuration template file is located inside the "config" folder.

Nevertheless, a short but more detailed basic example configuration of how to set up the client is given in the ([wiki](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/wiki/Example-configuration)).
