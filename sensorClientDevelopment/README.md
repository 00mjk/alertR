# AlertR Sensor Client Development

This client is only for developers. It has no purpose than to emulate sensors and to trigger them via keyboard input. This means it can not be used as a daemon and have to be actively used.


## How to use it?

To use this client you have to configure it first. A commented configuration template file is located inside the "config" folder.

If you need a more detailed description of how to set up an AlertR system, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/wiki).
