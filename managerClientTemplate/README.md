# AlertR Manager Client Template

This client stores the state of the AlertR system in local objects to provide a template for developers to build a manager client.


## How to use it?

To use this client you have to configure it first. A commented configuration template file is located inside the "config" folder. An init.d example file for Debian systems is located inside the "init.d_example" folder if you want to start the server with the start of the host computer.

If you need a more detailed description of how to set up an AlertR system, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/sqall01/alertR/wiki).
