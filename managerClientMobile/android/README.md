alertR Mobile Manager - Android
======


How to use it?
======

Just install the Android client to your mobile device (in case alertR is used more widely, I will add the Android client to the google play store) and configure everything in the settings. You should use HTTPS for the connection to your webserver (note: when your used certificate is not installed to your mobile device, the client refuses to connect to the server). The client is a simple client software that just uses HTTP(S) to connect to the server and logs in via http authentication (actually, it just displays a website written for mobile devices, but handles the log in credentials as configurable options).
