alertR Alert Client XBMC
======

This client handles triggered alerts and is written to communicate with XBMC/Kodi. It can show a message notification on the display and can pause video/audio playback (for now). For example you can use this client to pause the video/audio playback and show a message notification if someone is rining the bell at your front door.


How to use it?
======

To use this client you have to configure it first. A commented configuration template file is located inside the "config" folder. A init.d example file for Debian systems is located inside the "init.d_example" folder if you want to start the client with the start of the host computer.

Nevertheless, a short but more detailed basic example configuration of how to set up the client is given in the document directory ([/docs/tutorial.md](/docs/tutorial.md)).
