alertR
======

alertR is an unified client/server based alerting system. Originally it was developed as an open source home security system, but soon it became apparent that it can be used in a great variety of scenarios where an alerting system is needed, for example as a simpler nagios to monitor the availability of a server/service.

Here a list of interesting usecases with alertR:
