# alertR

alertR is a client/server based alarm and monitoring system. Originally it was developed as an open source home security system, but soon it became apparent that it can be used in a great variety of scenarios where an alarm or monitoring system is needed, for example as a simpler nagios to monitor the availability of a server/service.
